# BMP Image Steganography Tool (LSB Method)
## Module Information
- Module Code: KH4017CMD  
- Module Title: Introduction to Programming  
- Academic Year: 2025/2026  
- Language: Python 3  
- Programming Style: Functional Programming  
## Project Overview
This project implements an image steganography application that hides secret text messages inside 24-bit BMP images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The application allows users to encode messages into images and later decode them without noticeable visual changes.
## Features
- Hide messages of any length (within image capacity)
- Extract hidden messages accurately
- Supports 24-bit BMP images only
- Uses Python standard library only
- No external dependencies
- Command-line interface
- Functional programming design
